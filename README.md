# Workmanship Manual

[The HTML/CSS Workmanship Manual](http://workmanship.io) is a collection of information I've gathered about how to write front-end code that can stand up to a bit of abuse. And then I made it space-themed. A lot of what is here is taken from a variety of sources, almost all of which are linked to in the Reasoning asides or Resources section.
